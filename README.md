MAS pair programming first part


Steps to reproduce any app.

1. Download the latest version of Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/

2. Clone this repository. Main contains apps that have been made by Shreyas, and the other branch contains apps made by Prajwal.

3. `git clone https://github.com/PrajwalBBharadwaj/MAS` or if you prefer ssh `git clone git@github.com:PrajwalBBharadwaj/MAS.git`

4. Open the required project with Android Studio. For example, open the Notes app.

5. For Notes, you need to first create a Firebase account. The steps do reproduce can be found here

6. Build the app using gradle

7. You can optinally connect your phone to the machine and directly install the app on the phone. The instructions to follow depending on the platform you are on can be found here https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device

Since this is just a playground, the apps are not fully functional. Only the Notes app is, which follows a very indepth tutorial and a really nice starter code.

The starter code is again provided in the youtube video mentioned before. The pre-req for it are learnt through the other apps such as using coroutines, async programming, button handling and so on.
